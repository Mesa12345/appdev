The story started with 40-year-old Na Hee-Do (Kim So-Hyun) taking her daughter Kim Min-Chae (Choi Myung-Bin) to a ballet competition. Hee-Do reminded Min-Chae that winning isn’t everything and what’s important is for Min-Chae to give her all to the competition. Min-Chae thought differently, saying that there was no point in being there if she was not competing to win. Still, Hee-Do tried to convince her otherwise.
While waiting for her turn to compete, Min-Chae felt defeated after seeing her ‘rival’ perform the number flawlessly. Min-Chae walked out of the competition and got disqualified. Hee-Do confronted Min-Chae but Min-Chae said she’ll quit ballet because she’s not good at it anyway.
The scene cut to Min-Chae going to Hee-Do’s childhood home where Hee-Do’s grandmother (Shin Hyun-Sook) lives. Min-Chae said she ran away from home and will live in that house temporarily, to which her grandma agreed. Min-Chae started to rummage through her mother’s old possessions and found Hee-Do’s old journal. Min-Chae read through it and started learning about her mother’s 19-year-old self (Kim Tae-Ri), including Hee-Do’s youthful aspirations, frustrations, and relationships.
In 1998, Na Hee-do (Kim Tae-ri) is a member of the school fencing team at Seonjung Girls' High School, but due to the IMF crisis, the team is disbanded. To continue pursuing her passion, she transfers to Taeyang High School and later manages to become a member of the National Fencing Team.
